# Secrets loader Gradle plugin

secretsLoader is a draft Gradle plugin to explore possibilities to manipulate build config and resource values secrets in new Variants API. It's only for Android projects with AGP 7.0+ and Gradle 7.0. It's highly experimental and most likely doesn't work. It's not yet published as well.
